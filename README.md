## Jegool Backend - GitHub repository 
> **Info**
> STATUS: UNDER DEVELOPMENT

In this repository, you will find the entire backend codebase for Jegool.
<br/>
<br/>
Our backend is developed using TypeScript, Node.js, and Express.js powered by a MySQL database.
We use Prisma as our ORM to interact with the database and Planetscale is our database hosting platform, which enables us to store our data safely.
For our authentication, we use Firebase's easy-to-use authentication APIs that meet our needs.
This jegool backend is deployed on render.
Jegool also is integrated with [Chapa](https://chapa.co) to process all our payment transactions.
